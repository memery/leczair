    Takes two frozenstate objects and combines them into one. Where their

        a = frozenstate.single('foo.bar', 3)
        b = frozenstate.single('foo.baz', 5)
        c = frozenstate.append(a, b)

    From this you might realise that we can fake mutable state by doing

        fs = frozenstate.append(fs, frozenstate.single(path, v))

    which will overwrite the fs object with the result you get if you take the
    fs object and change one of its members to a new value. Doing this might
    not be a good idea.

    My recommendation is to aggregate changes to the state (in, say, a list or
    a generator) and then apply them all atomically. This will make your state
    easier to reason about since at any point in your program it will be either
    in state A or state B, never will it be halfway between the two states.
    Aggregating changes before applying them might also be useful for logging
    and transactional purposes â€“ you can keep a record of all changes applied
    to the state, and roll them back if you need to.
